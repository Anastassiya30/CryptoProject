# CryptoProject

A project in which I developed a bot like a money changer. A bot that helps user to find out currency he needs in a seconds.
Money changer has the following functions:
1. start command with "/start" or "/issue" commands;
2. opportunity to read instructions for using the currency exchanger;
3. opportunity to select currency you need from available currencies list;
4. error notification and advice (how to fix it) if the user entered incorrect data;
5. calculate currencies and get the required amount.
This money changer is easy to use and quick to respond.
